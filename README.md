# Fake-vs-Real-News-Detection-using-RNN.ipynb
Fake news is one of the major challenges in the digital age, where unverified and misleading information spreads quickly through the internet. This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to classify news articles as Real or Fake.
